## Description
The Sierra Leonean LEONE (SLL) is redenominated by removing three (3) zeros from the denominations. A new currency code SLE/925 representing the new valuation
(1â€™000 times old SLL/694) is introduced on 1st July 2022 for any internal needs during the redenomination process, and is replacing SLL as the official currency code.
The Bank of Sierra Leone will adopt the new code in the local system but SLL/694 shall remain in use until further notice.

This application is now used to guide users to exactly convert the old leones note to the new leones.
